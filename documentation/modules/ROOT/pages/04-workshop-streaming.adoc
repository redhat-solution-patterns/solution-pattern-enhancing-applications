== Adding Event Streaming capabilities to the application

=== Introduction

To support the business requirement of capturing and processing user activity on the Globex Coolstuff application, two new services have been developed:

* *Activity Tracking service*: This service exposes a REST endpoint. User activities on the Coolstuff website (such as opening a product page, liking a product etc..) generates an activity payload which is sent to the Activity tracking REST endpoint. The service transforms this payload into a Kafka message which is sent to a topic on the Kafka broker.
* *Recommendation Engine*: This service consumes and processes the events produced by the Activity Tracking service. The service uses the Kafka Streams library to continuously determine the top featured products (the products which generate the most activities).
The service also exposes a REST endpoint to expose the list of featured products.

Both services are developed using Quarkus and the Quarkus extensions for reactive messaging and Kafka Streams. The development of the services is outside the scope of this workshop, but you are encouraged to examine the source code of the applications on GitHub: link:https://https://github.com/app-modernization-workshop-globex/activity-tracking-service[Activity Tracking Service] and link:https://github.com/app-modernization-workshop-globex/recommendation-engine[Recommendation Engine]

For the Kafka platform, the workshop uses Red Hat AMQ Streams for Apache Kafka. AMQ Streams includes an Operator to make it easy to run a Kafka service on Red Hat OpenShift. The service can be very easily consumed and used by developers.


=== Activities

In this part of the workshop you will:

* Provision and configure an AMQ Streams instance for Apache Kafka.


=== Environment and prerequisites

The Globex Coolstuff application is deployed on an OpenShift cluster in a separate namespace. All activities in this part of the workshop can be done in the OpenShift console and do not require any tools to be installed on your workstation.

Prerequisites:

* A Red Hat Account
* Optional: `oc` CLI installed on your workstation.

=== Step-By-Step Instructions

==== Explore the environment

. In a browser window, navigate to the console of your OpenShift cluster. Open the *Developer* perspective in the *globex* namespace.
. In the Developer perspective, open the *Topology* view. Expect to see something like this (rearrange the topology as you see fit):
+

+
The deployed topology consists of:
+
** `globex-ui`: The Globex Coolstuff web application (Node.js/Angular). 
** `catalog-app`: The Globex Coolstuff catalog service, consisting of the catalog database and the Spring Boot catalog microservice.
** `inventory-app`: The Globex Coolstuff inventory service, consisting of the inventory database and the Quarkus inventory microservice.
** `activity-tracking`: The Activity Tracking service. Notice that the deployment of the service is scaled to zero. The service will be scaled up once the connection to the Kafka broker is set up.
**  `recommendation-engine`: The Recommendation Engine service. Notice that the deployment of the service is scaled to zero. The service will be scaled up once the connection to the Kafka broker is set up.
** `activity-tracking-simulator`: A Quarkus service that simulates user activity events and sends them to the Activity Tracking service.
. Find the route to the *Globex UI* application and open the URL in your browser.. Expect to see the home page of the Globex Coolstuff web application:
+
image::04/globex-coolstuff-home-page.png[]
+
Click on *Cool Stuff Store* in the top menu to see a paginated list of products:
+
image::04/globex-coolstuff-product-page.png[]
+
Note the _Featured_ pane on the home page, which is empty at the moment. Also the product list page has an empty bar above the product list. These elements will be populated once the recommendation engine is up and running.
